// Time Complexity : O(log N), where N is the index of the target or the nearest bound
// Space Complexity : O(1)
// Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes
// Any problem you faced while coding this :
// I had trouble figuring out how to determine the upper bound for binary search.
// If I searched or went in linear fashion it would be a O(N) time which is not the expected time limit. 
// I wasnâ€™t sure how to logically set the maximum search limit without knowing the array size.
//  To get those search limits I have used some resources. 
// Once the bounds were established, implementing binary search was straightforward.

// Your code here along with comments explaining your approach in three sentences only:
// I used exponential backoff to find an appropriate upper bound since the array size is unknown.
// Once the bound was found, I applied a standard binary search between the lower and upper bounds.
// I also handled the case where the index is out of bounds by checking for INT_MAX, as specified in the problem.
